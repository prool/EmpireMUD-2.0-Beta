The woody stems sprout lush green bushes and the earth buckles as roots grow underneath!~
X
crop around plants cassava roots stems bushes shrubs field~
   Tall stalks of cassava rise all around you. Their thin, woody stems are
topped with clusters of broad, hand-shaped leaves that spread out in the sun.
The plants stand in loose rows, each one rooted in mounded soil to give the
heavy tubers room to grow. The air has a faint, earthy smell as the leaves
rustle in the breeze.

   Broad-leaved yam vines sprawl in every direction. Heart-shaped leaves climb
from low mounds of earth and twist across the rows. The air is warm and damp,
with the earthy aroma of freshly turned soil.

Bits of sweet fluff take to the wind as the field bursts open with pink cotton!~
X
bush cotton candy plants bushes crop~
   Your eyes widen at the sight of the fluffy pink clouds of cotton candy
growing on this singular, enormous bush. You have seen few sights in this life
that compare to this plant; surely it cannot be natural. The sweet smell that
floats on the wind is enough to make you drool in anticipation -- you can
almost taste the candy.
