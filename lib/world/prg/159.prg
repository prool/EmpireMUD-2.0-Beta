Goblin Construction~
   You've heard that goblins sell a lot of uniquely useful building schematics
and supply tents. Build each of these buildings from the Shipwrecked Goblin
Horde: crabpens, sharkfold, goblin mess tent, goblin construction tent, and
goblin horde tent. And be sure to claim them.

Money Won't Solve Everything, But it Works on Goblins~
   That worked... surprisingly well. You paid the goblin raiders and they left.
If this spares even a single life, it was worth the expense. That's sure to
make you popular with your citizens.
