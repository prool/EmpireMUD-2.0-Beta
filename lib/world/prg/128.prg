Lodestone Forge~
   Your empire has reached Lodestone Forge, the first of the Celestial Forges,
devoted to working iron in all its forms. Since the early days of civilization,
blacksmiths have supported buildings and armies alike with their metalworks. 
Every sword and nail that built the empire started in the hands of a smith.
