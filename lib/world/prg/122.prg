Tale of the Ribbon Serragon~
   Scouts have returned with grim news: a ribbon serragon has been sighted
nesting deep within the forest. The beast is too dangerous to leave unchecked;
it will consume livestock and woodsman alike. Track it to its pit and slay it
before it can bring ruin to the land. Bring back its skull, rare and whole, as
proof of your deed, and carry its bleeding heart to the city to consecrate a
new shrine. Honor the serragon's power and memory to bring glory to your
empire!
