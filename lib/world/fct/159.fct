Shipwrecked Goblins~
   A well-equipped group of goblins have taken to the seas and begun raiding
coasts all over the world. No one knows where they've come from but their goal
seems clear: they're here to pillage. Still, rumors abound that some kingdoms
have had success trading with the newcomers.
