Ribbon Serragon~
Paul Clarke~
   You've stumbled across a massive pit yawning in the forest floor -- too
smooth and too deep to be any ordinary sinkhole. You've heard that livestock
from nearby farms have gone missing, dragged off in the night with only long
furrows in the soil to mark the struggle. Now, even townsfolk have disappeared,
their tracks leading toward the same stretch of woods. The locals whisper
uneasily, their eyes darting whenever the subject is raised.
   Some claim the pit is the lair of a monstrous serpent, others say it's the
work of a dragon that burrows instead of flying. The boldest insist it is the
dwelling of the ribbon serragon, a whirling mass of streamers large enough to
eat a bull. Around the tavern tables, rumors stretch further: that the
creatures grind whole trees to splinters with their scales, that their blood
glows like sunlight in a pond. Most dismiss such tales as fancy... but no one
can deny the growing list of names gone missing, or the sound of earth
shifting at night as if something vast is moving just beneath the roots.
