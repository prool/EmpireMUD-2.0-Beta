shipwreck wreck salvage~
the shipwreck~
There's a shipwreck here, half salvaged.~
   From the wreckage, it appears the ship was going full speed when it hit the
land. You can see where parts must have landed when they splintered off the
hull, but most of the ship has been salvaged already, so there isn't a lot left
to look at.

the wavewhisperer's tent~
A rather ornate blue tent stands on the crest of a hill.~
   Rarely have you seen so rich a blue dye as the one used on this tent; it
captures the mercurial essence of the sea, which can be a pacific calm one
minute and a ravaging tsunami the next. The tent seems to be made from canvas,
or something similar; the stitching is quite small, like goblincraft.

the crabherd's tent~
A reinforced orange tent covers a shallow pit.~
   The tent is rather torn and frayed along the base which, you quickly notice,
has been staked to the ground by dozens of wooden stakes, placed every few
inches. Around the lower margins, you can see something pressing against the
canvas -- lots of somethings. And they're moving.

the scribe's tent~
A small fuchsia tent stands before you.~
   The bright fuchsia color of the tent is difficult to miss as it stands like
a beacon to the raiding party. It isn't very large; you'll be stooped the
entire time you're inside. Best to take a big breath before you enter, as the
harsh smoke billowing from the top vent suggests inside will be thick with
soot.

tent goblin mess~
a goblin mess tent~
There is a goblin mess tent standing here.~
   The tent stands tall, open on the sides but protected from the weather
above. Perhaps surprisingly, the area beneath the tent is an orderly collection
of foods of all types, from canned fruit to smoked meat.

a goblin construction tent~
A large tent stands here, filled with construction material.~
   The patchwork leather tent stretches wide, holding a great number of
construction materials from wood to stone, and even some tools. The tent is
open at the sides, but the top is stitched tight to prevent any of it from
getting wet.

the patchwork dirigible~
A patchwork dirigible floats overhead.~
   Though it looks like it's held together by a lot of leather and a little
hope, the dirigible actually seems to be floating quite well. A rope ladder
descends from the side of the basket.

A great goblin hoard tent stands here, gleaming.~
   The well-appointed tent covers a trove of treasures and unique items, piled
neatly for all to see. Though it's clearly goblincraft, it's in much better
condition than most goblin items you come across.
