An iron age chariot is parked here.~
   The small chariot rests on two wheels, supported by a long pole shaft
leading to a yoke for two animals. It's an agile vehicle which was once the key
to both warfare and sport racing in the ancient world. The front is protected
by a mottled hide and iron tires protect both wheels.
