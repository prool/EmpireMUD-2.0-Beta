ability bonus~
a bonus ability~
A bonus ability is here.~
   This item grants a player 1 to 3 new bonus abilities after a very brief
delay, with an announcement message. This helps separate the 'you gain an
ability' message from other text. Set val0, val1, and val2 to up to 3 abilities
you want the player to gain.
   Load this item with a script and change the vals before the 'wait' happens.
