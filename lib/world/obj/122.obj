blood pit walls~
all the blood~
A tremendous amount of blood is spattered across the pit.~
   Blood in two different colors paint a grim scene across the earthen walls
and woodchip floor of the pit. In the low light, it forms a grim artwork of
verdigris and vermillion. Something great died here.

pit~
the pit~
There's a pit in the middle of the forest.~
   The forest floor ends at the mouth of a wide pit, scoured clean by something
vast and relentless. The walls of the pit are lined with gouges and slashes
where the soil has been scraped raw in a spiraling pattern, leaving roots
dangling with frayed ends.

corpse tremendous vermilion serragon~
the tremendous corpse of the vermilion serragon~
The vermilion ribbon serragon sprawls around you, dim and lifeless.~
   The vermilion serragon's length sprawls across the ground in broken coils,
its fiery red scales darkened with cracks and streaks of dust. The once-proud
jaws now lie twisted and limp. Its eyes, once sharp and unblinking rubies, are
glazed with a black, lifeless sheen. The rows of hooked teeth glint faintly, as
if waiting for a breath that will never come.

corpse twisted veridian serragon scales~
the twisted corpse of the veridian serragon~
The viridian ribbon serragon lies in a twisted heap atop fallen scales.~
   The viridian serragon's body lies slack in a loose coil, like a flattened
worm collapsed into the earth. The once-glossy scales now look like they're
covered in verdigris, dull, chipped, and cracked where blows struck deep. The
creature's wide, leaflike crest sags against the soil, torn in places and
drained of its shimmer. Its needled teeth are mostly broken, piled below the
slackened jaw and glassy, absent gaze.
