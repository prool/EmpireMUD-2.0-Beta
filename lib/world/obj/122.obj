blood pit walls~
all the blood~
A tremendous amount of blood is spattered across the pit.~
   Blood in two different colors paint a grim scene across the earthen walls
and woodchip floor of the pit. In the low light, it forms a grim artwork of
verdigris and vermillion. Something great died here.

pit~
the pit~
There's a pit in the middle of the forest.~
   The forest floor ends at the mouth of a wide pit, scoured clean by something
vast and relentless. The wlls of the pit are lined with gouges and slashes
where the soil has been scraped raw in a spiraling pattern, leaving roots
dangling with frayed ends.
