blood pit walls~
all the blood~
A tremendous amount of blood is spattered across the pit.~
   Blood in two different colors paint a grim scene across the earthen walls
and woodchip floor of the pit. In the low light, it forms a grim artwork of
verdigris and vermillion. Something great died here.

pit~
the pit~
There's a pit in the middle of the forest.~
   The forest floor ends at the mouth of a wide pit, scoured clean by something
vast and relentless. The walls of the pit are lined with gouges and slashes
where the soil has been scraped raw in a spiraling pattern, leaving roots
dangling with frayed ends.

a pile of twisted serragon dung~
A great pile of twisted serragon dung is steaming a little too close to you.~
   The massive pile of dung is still warm and, certainly, quite pungent.
Hidden amongst small bones and rocks are a few remnants of twigs and,
surprisingly frilled seeds still whole and intact.
   You could try planting the dung somewhere.
   Ribbon serragons are known to swallow anything that will fit between its
jaws. Their trails are scraped raw, leaving no plant, beast, or rock behind.
The inedible parts churn and roil to break up the rest.

whistle earthworm worm giant mount~
a giant earthworm mount whistle~
A giant earthworm mount whistle is lying on the ground.~
   The whistle is crafted from a hollow acorn shell fitted with a smooth sliver
of oak, bound with threads of dried moss. Tiny grooves spiral down its sides
like the tunnels of a burrowing worm. A faint earthy smell lingers on the
whistle. When blown, it gives a low, humming note.
   You can 'use' this whistle to summon a giant earthworm, a new mount.
   Hunters whisper that the vermilion ribbon is always the more aggressive of
the pair with its jagged crest reputed to be a sign that it's ready for a
fight. The redder serragon is said to burn brightly to defend its mate.

whistle caterpillar giant mount~
a giant caterpillar mount whistle~
A giant caterpillar mount whistle is lying here.~
   The whistle is fashioned from a curled oak leaf, dried and lacquered until
it holds its shape, with tiny veins etched in silver along its surface. A bit
of willow twig forms the mouthpiece, and when blown it releases a soft,
rustling tone.
   You can 'use' this whistle to summon a giant caterpillar, a new mount.
   Travelers say the viridian ribbon serragon is always the calmer of the two.
Old poachers call it 'the brooding coil,' for it lingers near the nest and
circles patiently, waiting for its mate's strike before it joins the fray.

a mossy sproutling minipet whistle~
A mossy sproutling minipet whistle is growing here.~
   The whistle is carved from a hollow twig of elderwood. Its surface is still
wrapped in a thin layer of living moss. Tiny shoots sprout from cracks along
its length, giving it the look of something half-grown rather than crafted.
   You can 'use' the whistle to gain  mossy sproutling as a minipet!
   Ribbon serragons are always found entwined, winding their bodies together so
closely that most who see them believe they are a single beast. Hunters say the
pair mates for life, fighting and feeding as one, grinding bark to powder as
they coil and carving long scars through the forest floor.

a pair of gemlike serragon scales~
A matched pair of serrated scales glimmer on the ground like cut jewels.~
   These two scales, shed from a ribbon serragon, gleam with a natural
brilliance. One is a deep ruby shot through with golden veins, the other a rich
emerald laced with hints of silver. Both are hard as stone and razor-edged
along their jagged margins. They look like they're from two different colored
beasts, but they interlock as if they were made together.
   Ribbon serragon scales are so rare and fragile that it is said lords have
sent armies to claim them.

a serragon coilstone~
A smooth, coiling stone has rolled to a stop on the ground.~
   The coilstone is a polished nodule formed deep within the bowel of a ribbon
serragon, where grit and minerals were churned together for years. It gleams
just below the surface like a pearl, with iridescent bands of vermilion and
viridian that twist into a natural spiral.
   Woodsmen say the forest itself stirs when a serragon is ready to give birth
as the creature uncoils to release a nest of wriggling young.

a frilled serragon skull~
The frilled skull of a serragon looms here.~
   This enormous skull once crowned a ribbon serragon, and finding one unbroken
is a prize beyond measure. Its long, narrow form is crowned with a frilled
crest of spines that splay outward like a jagged fan, sharp as broken obsidian.
Rows upon rows of teeth still jut from the gaping jaws; lifeless now after
taking so many lives themselves.
   Woodsmen tell grim stories of whole timber camps erased overnight -- men
return to find splinters and woodchips, with no sign of their comrades except
the scent of blood that leads back to the nest of the ribbon serragon.

The half-digested corpse of a large bear is lying on the ground.~
   Most of the fur from the corpse has been eaten away by the foul-smelling
stomach acid or beaten away by the churning rocks in whatever stomach this bear
found itself in. The upper torso is riddled with needle-like puncture marks and
most of the claws are missing. You turn away before the smell overtakes you.

an intact ribbon serragon tooth~
An intact ribbon serragon tooth is staked into the ground.~
   The needle-like fang, knocked loose in a great struggle, is nearly flawless.
It's also nearly the length of your forearm. Its surface is glassy and faintly
striated, translucent when it catches the light.
   Those skilled in jewelry can sew a needle tooth cloak with this fang as its
clasp.
   Hunters prize such fangs as rare ornaments, since few survive intact when
the beast is slain. They're known to adorn their clothes with these fangs to
show off their greatness in battle.

A cloak clasped with a tooth is lying here.~
   Though the cloak is elegant enough on its own, it is the large clasp at the
cloak's throat that truly makes it unique. The clasp is made from the polished
needle fang of a ribbon serragon, translucent nd gleaming faintly in the light.
   Hunters say such clasps mark those who have braved the coils and lived; that
the fang a sign that the forest's deadliest predator could not defeat them.

a many-lobed serragon lung~
A massive, many-lobed lung lies flattened on the ground.~
   The enormous lung stretches longer than a man is tall. Its rubbery flesh
branches into a maze of small lobes and chambers. Though heavy, the lung is
surprisingly elastic, and when pressed it releases faint wheezes from its
countless pockets.
   With this lung, you can sew lunghide trousers, provided you have the
Leatherworking ability.
   Hunters sometimes complain of ribbon serragon flesh being tough and stringy,
though it's rich with fat and keeps for weeks if dried, so desperate camps have
lived on it after a lucky kill.

A pair of lunghide pants is folded up on the ground.~
   These trousers are fashioned from the elastic hide of a ribbon serragon's
enormous lung. The many branching lobes are cleverly stitched into place as
natural pouches, resulting in dozens of tiny pockets hidden across the surface.
   The rasp of ribbon serragon scales is often mistaken for saws in the
distance. All the more tragic for the lost woodsman thinking he's heading back

The vermilion ribbon serragon sprawls around you, dim and lifeless.~
   The vermilion serragon's length sprawls across the ground in broken coils,
its fiery red scales darkened with cracks and streaks of dust. The once-proud
jaws now lie twisted and limp. Its eyes, once sharp and unblinking rubies, are
glazed with a black, lifeless sheen. The rows of hooked teeth glint faintly, as
if waiting for a breath that will never come.

   The viridian serragon's body lies slack in a loose coil, like a flattened
worm collapsed into the earth. The once-glossy scales now look like they're
covered in verdigris, dull, chipped, and cracked where blows struck deep. The
creature's wide, leaflike crest sags against the soil, torn in places and
drained of its shimmer. Its needled teeth are mostly broken, piled below the
slackened jaw and glassy, absent gaze.

the heliacal heart of a ribbon serragon~
A great, coiled heart glows faintly in a puddle of blood.~
   Its shape is twisted in radiant whorls, still warm to the touch and heavy
with sloshing blood. The surface of the heart gleams faintly, as if lit from
within by the last rays of sunlight caught in its chambers.
   The blood from this heart could be used to build a ribbon serragon shrine
in awe or in fear of the vicious creature.
   Some villages once gathered in the spring at shrines to the ribbon serragon,
weaving long bands of red and green cloth through the trees.

   The fresh gourds twist in loose coils, some nearly forming knots in their
length. The skins are smooth and cool to the touch, mottled with green stripes.
When you split one open, the flesh within is pale and moist, with a sweet
scent. A strip of vine bundles the gourds together.

A small, curling snake gourd pokes up from the ground.~
   This young snake gourd is only a few hands long. Its coil is still tight,
but its skin is soft enough to bite right through. The skin is white, not the
mottled green of the mature fruit. Inside, it's pale and watery, with a
freshness that makes it a favored snake for man and beast alike.
