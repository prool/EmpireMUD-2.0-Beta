   This book is thick, but narrow, being comprised of cards of stiff parchment
rather than fine pages. Its cover is hardened and then covered in two layers of
silk to protect its contents and also allow for a few more recipes to be stuck
in. Embroidered on the outer layer is the title "The Imperial Chef".

A set of wintry wooden chocolate molds have been set out here.~
   Made for the holiday season, both religious and secular symbols are
represented. This set includes roughly two dozen shapes: Santa Claus, Mrs.
Claus, elf, reindeer, icicle, snowflake, snowman, jingle bell, Christmas tree,
stuffed stocking, pinecone, holly bush, fir branches, menorah, dreidel,
nutcracker, sleigh, igloo, pentagram, krampus, Sami drum, mistletoe, and of
course, a festively enchanted map of your favorite empire (use the empire name
as the shape). Rumor has it the products from this mold have some sort of magic
about them, but there's nothing about the candy molds themselves to suggest it.

Chocolate has been molded into a tiny humanoid with pointed ears and a festive outfit, holding a small knife and a piece of what appears to be pine wood. You could swear you hear a tiny jingle from the bells on his hat or shoes, though you never catch him moving. The longer you watch, the more the carving resembles your favorite childhood toy. Magic is clearly at work. The inside of this chocolate is surprisingly filled with sunflower seeds.~

This chocolate reindeer is outfitted with a harness, the straps meant to attach it to a sleigh dangling free without the sleigh present. The nose is definitely glowing red, clear evidence of the presence of magic. The inside is filled with a warm, chewy caramel that mimics the actual body temperature of a living organism and yet it does not melt in your hand from the internal warmth or from the warmth you provide as you hold it.~

A chocolate icicle dangles here.~
M
21
This long, thin, delicate piece of chocolate is clearly an icicle, starting thicker up top and tapering to a needle thin point. The presence of magic is indicated by the fact that it's dangling before you in midair rather than lying on anything, a translucent white in color, cold to the touch, and seems to chime slightly in a passing breeze. Its chill gives the chocolate a crisp snap when bitten and there is a lingering aftertaste of wintergreen.~

M

This lacey chocolate is in the shape of a snowflake, delicately pointed in all directions and appearing thin enough to shatter if touched.  Magic has clearly had a hand in its formation as it seems to drift on a breeze, floating languidly toward the ground, but never reaching it, always stopping wherever your hand is.  Though it is cold to the touch, it does not melt in the warmth of your hand. It is too thin for a filling, but the cold chocolate snaps crisply and leaves behind the faint aftertaste of coconut.~

This bit of chocolate looks like a Christmas tree, complete with ornaments, tinsel, lights and garland. The lights actually glow and the tree seems to have roots digging into the floor, showing that illusionary magic is at work, as the treat is actually easy to lift. It looks to be solid chocolate, but leaves a surprise aftertaste of warm maple on the tongue when eaten.~

This chocolate has the bulging boot shape of a well-stuffed stocking, its hanger stiff and upright, slightly open as if hanging on a nail by a hearth. Alas, when you try to reach in and pluck out whatever's attached to the bright red bow poking out of the stocking's mouth, it dissolves into bright blue sparkles of pure mana. The inside of the stocking is actually full of hazelnut nougat.~

Complete with feathery needles and the faint scent of fir, this chocolate is clearly enchanted. The feathery needles, appearing to be lightly covered in snow, shiver slightly as if in a breeze, sending the flakes off in shimmering sparkles.

The nine branches of this chocolate menorah each hold a tiny candle. In this arrangement, the shamash, the candle that would be used to light all the others, is in the center and raised slightly. It is already glowing warmly, indicating an enchantment at work. If you watch long enough, the other candles slowly light, one at a time. When you bight into this treat, the creamy, nutty flavors of halva you don't recall preparing fill the insides of the chocolate.~

This chocolate has been shaped into a dreidel. It is clearly enchanted as it stands on its end spinning so rapidly that its letters, formed of almond slivvers you don't recall pressing into the chocolate, are a blur.  When your hand reaches toward it, it stops spinning. Somehow this one always lands on "gimel" and you get to eat the whole delicious thing, which turns out to be filled with marzipan.~

This chocolate nutcracker is dressed like a soldier from your favorite empire. His mouth grips a nut you didn't add and cracks it with a loud *snap* as you watch. The shell disintegrates into bright blue mana and the nut's softer insides go down into the chocolate, ready to be eaten.~

When one package disintegrates, another forms in its place when you withdraw your hand. A tasting reveals the inside of the sleigh to be full of cool peppermint cream you don't recall adding.~

Perhaps the only piece in the collection that appears completely ordinary, this piece of chocolate is molded into a five-pointed star with a circle around it. It lies there innocently, perfectly ordinary in color and scent. Only when you  take a bite does the magic reveal itself. It is filled with a sweet and spicy mix of pumpkin, ginger, nutmeg and cloves -- a pumpkin pie fully enclosed in a chocolate shell rather than an open pastry one.~

M
21
Tiny and round, this chocolate sami drum is intricately decorated with spiritual motifs you didn't add to the molds. Clearly enchantment is at work as the pulk rises and hits the drum by itself, producing a resonant and compelling sound that is out of all proportion with the actual materials and size of what is, after all, a piece of hollow chocolate candy.~

This is clearly a piece of chocolate, but it has just as clearly been enchanted for playful mischief.  It floats in the air just over your head until you become aware of its presence. When you do, it allows you to grasp and eat it, leaving the warm sensation of a kiss on your cheek as the sweet texture and taste of cream-filled chocolate coats your tongue.~

M
22
An intricate chocolate map of %empire_name% has been molded from solid chocolate, with key locations and terrain features marked. This one is definitely enchanted as it seems to glow from within, showing not only the largest gatherings, but also those with the most genuine enthusiasm for the season. In fact, smaller but more heartfelt festivities are more brightly colored than large ones that might be attended out of obligation. Each section of the map is differently flavored according to the tastes of the citizenry, clearly another sign of enchantment rather than using ingredients you recall adding.~
