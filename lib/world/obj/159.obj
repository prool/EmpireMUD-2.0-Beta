a burning banner~
A banner burns over the wreckage.~
   The banner is too charred to make out what it might once have depicted. It
crisps and crackles in the wind for quite a while; it must have been soaked in
tallow or beeswax.

A schematic for goblin hacksilver crowns lies here.~
   This hastily-drawn schematic shows a series of goblincraft crowns made from
bits of hacksilver. Unfortunately, the schematic is badly smudged and you can
only make out 1 of the schematics.
   Type 'learn hacksilver' to learn one of the five crown crafts; this will
require you know how to make Jewelry. Each time you learn one of these
schematics, you gain 1 more of the crowns. Once you know all five, this item
will have no use. The crowns are: hacksilver-plated raider's hat, crown of
melted plunder, silver-scavver's crest, hacksilver diadem, and loot-lord's
crown.

cannot see lines where the artisan worked it. The shape gives the impression of
a tiny dirigible, all the more so because it floats.
   With this trinket, a skilled woodworker can manufacture a patchwork
dirigible, a vehicle held aloft by a giant leather balloon and the enchantment
from this trinket.
