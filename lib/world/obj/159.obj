banner burning~
a burning banner~
A banner burns over the wreckage.~
   The banner is too charred to make out what it might once have depicted. It
crisps and crackles in the wind for quite a while; it must have been soaked in
tallow or beeswax.
   Goblins long ago learned the meaning of a flag and are quick to carry one
into any invasion.

   You can use this to build a 'goblin mess tent', a simple storage tent that

   Goblins will use anything of value for money, usually hacking it apart into
coin-sized pieces. Many merchants are used toa goblin paying with short lengths
of chain, the stem of a goblet, or half a hat buckle.

bits of hacksilver. Unfortunately, the schematic is badly smudged and you can
only make out 1 of the schematics.
   Type 'learn hacksilver' to learn one of the five crown crafts; this will
require you know how to make Jewelry. Each time you learn one of these
schematics, you gain 1 more of the crowns. Once you know all five, this item
will have no use. The crowns are: hacksilver-plated raider's hat, crown of

   There's nothing more frightening than a horde of goblins arriving on the

of waterwalking goblins racing toward them.

a hovering jade trinket in the shape of a dirigible~
A small jade trinket hovers in the air.~
   The trinket is carved from veined jade by fine tools -- so fine that you
cannot see lines where the artisan worked it. The shape gives the impression of
a tiny dirigible, all the more so because it floats.
   With this trinket, a skilled woodworker can manufacture a patchwork
dirigible, a vehicle held aloft by a giant leather balloon and the enchantment
from this trinket.
   Goblin magic once held great stones in the air, or so it is said. Today, it
is considered a great feat that it can hold up a leather balloon. But such a
thing is possible with the right chant.

A goblin hoard tent is lying here.~
   This bundled mass of leather and sticks is a goblin hoard tent. Setting it
up will require more resources, but it's made to shelter all manner of pilfered
treasures and gems.
   Use this item to build a 'goblin hoard tent', a storage tent that holds all
manner of looted collectibles and gems.
   The lootcaller's job is to assign found items to each goblin and then dish
them out to the survivors at the end of the raid.

a True Fragment of Waur~
A True Fragment of Waur lies on the ground.~
   Though you know what it's called, it just looks like a chunk of rock that
someone chiseled out of a quarry.
   In the early days, tall rocks were the focus of goblin worship.

A cracked ceramic gnome is lying here.~
   This delicate, painted ceramic figure has the shape of a gnome: it's a small
man with a large, round nose and a red pileus cap. Despite a crack down its
back side, it's quite finely made and may be worth some money.
   The presence of a gnome in one's garden is said to bring good luck. However,
openly displaying one's sculptures can also bring goblins.

a calendar stick~
A calendar stick is lying here.~
   This long, straight stick bears rough notches and carvings at regular
intervals, divided by solid lines. The markings don't mean much to you, but
this one stick might hold months or even years of precious records from a
village somewhere.
   An old raidscribe can rattle off the details of battles long, long ago with
little more than a pass of the fingers.

an up-market brass doorknob~
An up-market brass doorknob is lying here.~
   Splinters of wood remain where this elegant knob was prised from its door.
The workmanship is excellent though, at the end of the day, it's still just a
doorknob.
   A shiny brass knob on the front door is a conspicuous way to show off one's
wealth to the neighbors as well as to any approaching raiders.

bone art goblin~
a goblin art bone~
A goblin art bone is sticking up.~
   Based on the ends, you'd say this is a femur. It's longer than your arm,
though it has been made thin through intricate carving, including some fine bas
relief. This work was done by tiny hands. The carvings appear to depict a ship,
a crowd of people, and a lot of graves. Symbols for different currencies appear
at the top of the scene as if they're floating in the sky.
   Wood is a prime building material for the modern goblin, and is thus never
available for art. Luckily -- for some -- goblins are good at finding other
things to do art to.

a modified brass chamberpot~
A modified brass chamberpot is rolling around.~
   This slightly dented chamberpot nevertheless appears to be made of fine
brass. The only concerning part is that someone has riveted it at the sides and
attached what appears to be a strap.
   Notoriously small in stature, goblins learn early to protect their heads.

a chest of silver~
A chest of silver is half-covered here.~
   You open the chest expecting riches, but it's completely empty. Luckily it
has been cast from pure silver.
   A nobleman once filled this chest with wooden nickels, but those are now
missing.
