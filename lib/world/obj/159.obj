banner burning~
a burning banner~
A banner burns over the wreckage.~
   The banner is too charred to make out what it might once have depicted. It
crisps and crackles in the wind for quite a while; it must have been soaked in
tallow or beeswax.

a bag of bent nails~
A bag of bent nails is spilling on the ground.~
   The bag, which smells rather similar to a barnyard in a rainstorm, is
stuffed so full of rusty, bent nails that it feels risky to even hold it.
