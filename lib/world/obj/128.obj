earrings.

The monomachus crown of victory has been left here.~
   Seven tall, obround imperium plates arranged side-to-side make up this
magnificent crown. Each bears a legendary empire depicted in a fine nocturnium
inlay and colored with brilliant cloisonne enamel. Oddly, the seventh pane has
no figure -- or, perhaps, no one worthy has yet emerged.

   This enormous gear is tremendously heavy, suggesting it is solid imperium
all the way to the core. It once drove the heart of a great siege machine; now
at best it functions as a shield. But with its large size, it's not a very
maneuverable one.
