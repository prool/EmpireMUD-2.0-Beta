rift elemental~
   The rift is unstable, and strong winds push you back as you approach it.
Flames lash out at you as you move closer and closer, and the wind becomes too
hot to handle. You will not be able to enter this rift.

   The air in the swamp is thick with moisture, and the ground is soft and

   The portal crackles and hisses with a strange energy that is at once natural

there are powerful natural forces at work here.

   Massive timbers have been constructed in a post-and-lintel circle large
enough to host a rather large party. It seems to be aligned to the winter
solstice. Close inspection of the wood shows scratch marks, as if wild animals
have been climbing it.
