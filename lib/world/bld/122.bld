pit deep depths down around forest~
   The forest floor ends at the mouth of a wide pit, scoured clean by something
vast and relentless. The walls of the pit are lined with gouges and slashes
where the soil has been scraped raw in a spiraling pattern, leaving roots
dangling with frayed ends.

trees~
   The trees around the pit are bent backwards and scraped clean of bark on
