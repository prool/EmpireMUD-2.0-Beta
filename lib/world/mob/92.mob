   The dog has a mottled black and buff coat, a bit like a mutt, but this is no
city dog. Its round ears look like a pair of plates affixes to its head, all
the better to hear prey at great distances or through thick grass. The last
half of its tail is white, making it easy to see as the dog prances across the
grassland. Its legs are long and thin, making it quick and quiet.

its red-orange skin serves as the first warning that it might be a threat. At
the back of its head, stray feathers give it the look of an archer's quill.
Its long neck allows it to snap forward and rip with its hooked beak, making it
just as dangerous as any archer.
