   The scrapboss is stocky, for a goblin. His skin is the palest shade of
green, to the point that it almost shimmers in direct light. His clothing is
leather, but bulges all over reveal the plates of metal and wood that are
crammed into every pocket. Near him sit a bag of nails and a travois laden with
scrapwood.

   The old whisperer has a deep jade complexion, though she has smeared a light
paste over her face and upper arms. Her violet cloth robes are stitched with
gleaming silver, though the edges are frayed and torn. Her face bears a serene
demeanor and her eyes never fix on a single point as she looks off. There's a
glass water pipe tucked under her arm.

wooden pole with a series of notched and grooved patterns, and it looks like
he's finishing the work.
