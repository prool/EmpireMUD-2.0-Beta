   This curious creature has the face of a fox with the wings of a bat.
Straw-colored fur around its eyes gives it the appearance that it's wearing a
pair of spectacles. There's also light fur on its shoulders and part of its
body, but the predominant color is black.

   A riot of color and grace, this bird seems almost unreal against the green
backdrop. Long plumes spill from its tail in cascading shades of gold, scarlet,
and deep indigo, catching the light every time it turns. When it dances, it
moves with a deliberate, almost ritualistic precision.

   This stocky, powerful beaver is well-suited to both labor and defense in
this rugged terrain. Its dense brown fur is slick with water and mud. Its
broad, paddle-like tail leaves a wide groove in the soft earth as it moves.

curve outward, with more than enough each to ruin the day of anybody standing
too close when it becomes alarmed.

   You see a brownish peahen foraging nearby. It is a large, sturdy bird, but
its plumage is mostly a subdued, earth-toned mix of grey and brown. Its only
significant ornament is a small, spiky Crest atop its head. Unlike the male, it
has a short, manageable tail and moves with a quiet, cautious grace.

red eyes are ringed by thick lashes, and it calls out with a loud echoing
